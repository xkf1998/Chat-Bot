Welcome to the Humorous Chatbot, an interactive application that combines information retrieval, humor, and conversation. This chatbot allows users to explore various topics, search the internet for information, and receive entertaining and amusing responses.

## Features

- **Conversational Experience**: Engage in a chat-like conversation with the chatbot, allowing you to ask questions or provide topics for exploration.

- **Humorous Responses**: Enjoy the chatbot's humorous and entertaining responses, adding a touch of laughter and amusement to the interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `openai`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `googlesearch-python`

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code files.

2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install openai requests beautifulsoup4 googlesearch-python
   ```

3. Obtain an OpenAI API key by creating an account on the OpenAI platform and generating an API key.

4. Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Run the Python script `humorous_chatbot.py`:
   ```
   python humorous_chatbot.py

## Customization

- Modify the list of prompts in the code to adjust the humor and tone of the chatbot's responses. Add more prompts or personalize the existing ones to suit your preferences.

- Experiment with the OpenAI API options such as temperature and max tokens to fine-tune the response generation process.

## Notes

- Web scraping can be subject to the terms of service of the websites you access. Be mindful and respectful when using the chatbot to search the internet.

- The chatbot's responses are generated by OpenAI's language model and may not always be accurate or reflect actual information. Verify information from reliable sources when needed.

- Remember to keep your OpenAI API key secure and avoid sharing it publicly.
